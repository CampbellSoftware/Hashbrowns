Hello, Hashbrownians.

This Readme is all about Hashbrowns, how to use it, and everything else. It will be contained in seperate entries, each discussing updates.

Welcome! If you are excited to see this repository, and see nothing in it, don't be afraid. I just have not make anything just yet.
I have made a few prototypes in the past, but none of them have turned out that good.
They were all cluttered messes, and they eventually stopped working.
This is why I need your help on this project.
I plan to make a prototype, and put it in here.
Since right now this is more of a hobby project, I don't have a deadline for the prototype.
But if you contribute, it could come out faster.
Thank you for all of your support!
